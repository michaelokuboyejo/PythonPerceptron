A Simple Neural Network in Vanilla Python
-----------------------------------------

This is a simple implementation of a Basic unit of a Neural Network or a Perceptron in pure python. 
The aim of this project is to demonstrate the basic operation (a very simplified version) of Neural Networks in popular frameworks/libraries.

The only requirement for this project is Numpy. I know I said Vanilla Python ðŸ™ˆðŸ˜¬ but Numpy abstracts heavy Math.

TODO
====

1. Benchmark this against a popular framework for the same task and compare the results (accuracy, speed of training etc) just for fun.
2. Use this for a Kaggle submission. Yay!
